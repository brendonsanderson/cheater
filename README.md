# Cheater

Cheater is a Python script designed to update a private GitHub repository anywhere from 0-4 times a day. The script utilizes the GitHub API for Python (PyGithub) and the schedule library for job scheduling.

# Usage

Before running the script, make sure to install the required libraries by running the following command:

```pip install PyGithub, schedule```

Replace 'YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN', 'your_username', and 'your_repo_name' with your GitHub personal access token, GitHub username, and the name of your private repository, respectively.
